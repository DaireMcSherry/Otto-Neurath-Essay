          <h1>What role did Otto Neurath play in the development of visual language and the ISOTYPE system?</h1> 
    </header>

          <h2 id="intro">INTRODUCTION</h2>
          
          <p>In the 1920s, Otto Neurath, a sociologist, mathematician and philosopher from Vienna, Austria, collaborated with the German artist Gerd Arntz to develop the ‘Vienna Method of Pictorial Statistics’. The method was later renamed the ‘International System of Typographic Picture Education’, known as ISOTYPE (Jansen, 2009: 227).</p> 
          
          <p>The following text presents, firstly, the context for Otto Neurath’s development of visual language which arose from a commission by the City of Vienna to educate the public about their city. Secondly, Neurath’s inspiration for using symbols to convey statistical information is explained with reference to his collaboration with the designer Marie Reidemeister and the graphic artist Gerd Arntz. Thirdly, Neurath’s six rules guiding the development of his visual language are summarised and illustrated with a 1920 pictogram of gainfully employed people in seven different countries. Lastly, the text concludes noting how  Neurath’s visual language and ISOTYPE system continues to inspire contemporary interactive and graphic designers.</p>
          
          <h2 id="back">BACKGROUND</h2>
          
          <p>Otto Neurath was born in Vienna, Austria in 1982 and died in Oxford, England in 1945. During his career in Vienna he founded a new museum which focused on housing and city planning which was called ‘Siedlungsmuseum’. Later, in 1925, Neurath renamed the museum the  Gesellschaft- und Wirtschafts Museum (Austrian Society and Economy Museum), As museum director, Neurath was commissioned  by the City Council to educate the Viennese public about the city (Rawsthorn, 2011). Due to the high levels of illiteracy, Neurath worked on using graphic design and images to create a visual language which would be easily understood by spectators from all levels of society. In this way, using icons, Neurath developed novel ways of representing considerable amounts of information, especially statistical data. </p>
          
          <h2 id="visu">VISUAL LANGUAGE</h2>
          
          <p>In the creation of visual language, Neurath was inspired by the economist Playfair who in 1901 used pictorial statistics to illustrate the balance of trade. He was also influenced by Brinton’s work and 1919 publication ‘ Graphic Methods for Presenting Facts’ which uses symbols to represent quantities. (Jansen, 2009).  In addition, Neurath drew on  the picture diagrams of the almanacs developed and distributed by the Habsburgs throughout the Austro-Hungarian Empire (Jansen,2009).  Neurath’s vision for the museum’s exhibits was expressed in the tenet that, “pictures make connection, words make division” (Twyman, 1982:9). Accordingly, he believed that incorporating visual elements in the museum’s exhibits could make information more approachable and understandable for a wider audience (Uyan Dur, 2015). </p>
          
          <p>One of Neurath’s main aims for the museum was to “familiarise and educate the working class about the broader systems of order at work in the contemporary city – not just its visual systems, but also its quantitative, social and political ones” (Vossoughian, 2008: 61). Therefore, Neurath wanted to create pictorial exhibitions which would inform the public about contemporary Viennese society including unemployment, industrial production, housing, emigration, physical and mental health, alcoholism and mortality (Uyan Dur, 2015). For example, through using pictorial statistics, Neurath aimed to illustrate societal trends and promote social understanding by giving, “fundamental, strictly scientific information for social understanding, even to the less educated, without depressing them in the way learned books and statistical tables do” (Jansen, 2009:229).  Regarding housing, the goal was to illustrate the development plan for Vienna by showing the range of home types for various groups of the population and how they would improve their health, reducing mortality and increasing longevity (Jansen, 2009: 229).</p>
          
          <p>In the development of visual language for the museum’s exhibits, Neurath believed that “iconic sign systems could stimulate the intellect and imagination in a way that letters and words alone could not” (Vossoughian, 2008:61). To achieve his vision, Neurath first of all, enlisted a German student, Marie Reidemeister. Reidemeister (later Neurath’s wife) was able to transform numerical data into sketches of pictorial statistics, initially using paper silhouettes and later linocuts. Subsequently, Neurath invited the graphic artist Gerd Arntz to collaborate on developing methods of using visual statistics as an educational tool. Neurath wanted to work with Arntz as he was skilled at making elementary signs and pictograms that could summarise a subject at a glance (Rawsthorn, 2011). </p>
          
          <p>Arntz contributed to the development of visual language and exhibits for the museum by creating a set of easily recognisable symbols to represent various objects, ideas and quantities. Indeed, Arntz was skilled at designing “.. signs and symbols with simplicity and accessibility in mind, but also so that they could be combined to form new pictograms” (Vossoughian, 2008: 91). Furthermore, Arntz also used the sans serif Futura font – designed by artist Paul Renner of the Bauhaus - to standardise the museum’s typeface, which was used for text and banners (Vossoughian, 2008: 91). The collaboration not only resulted in using visuals to create exhibitions that would engage the wider public but also in the setting up the International Foundation for Visual Education (Muller, 2017).</p>
          
          <p>In the development of visual language, Neurath was guided by six rules.  Firstly, he maximised using objects and symbols; every sign should be represented in a different way. Secondly, every sign with a graphic diagram had to be two-dimensional; Neurath maintained that three-dimensional diagrams distracted viewers with unnecessary illusions. Thirdly, every schema should contain “speaking signs” that conveyed only minimum, essential information. Fourthly, colour should be used as a tool to distinguish between different humans, for example, “men dark, women light, elderly grey” (Vossoughian, 2008: 63). Moreover, the background of a sign should indicate location such as green for countryside and grey for city. Fifthly, Neurath established criteria which pictures had to meet if they were to be pedagogically suitable. Specifically, a picture should only need three glances for the information to be conveyed to the observer: with the first glance the viewer should see the most important aspect of the subject and distinguishable differences; with the second glance, the most significant details are observed; with the third glance, all details are noted. Neurath excluded pictures which would require more glances (Neurath, 1917, cited in Vossoughian, 2008: 63).</p>
          
          <p>Sixth and lastly, to facilitate using graphic signs for instruction, any individual should be able to cut them out and paste them separately; this would be especially time saving for teachers. Neurath also maintained this process would actively involve “the masses” in producing knowledge (Vossoughian, 2008: 65). In short, Neurath's graphic methods benefited the public in thinking independently and in perceiving and understanding “the world around them in terms of patterns, relationships and systems of organisation” (Vossoughian, 2008: 65). Neurath’s rules for representational techniques are illustrated in Figure 1 and in Figure 2 below. </p>

          <p>In Figure 2 above, each symbol (the silhouette of a man) represents an employed person. When several symbols are combined to form a pictogram, side by side, each symbol represents a specific number or quantity of unemployed people (noted at the bottom of the page). Each occupation is represented by a colour explained in the key at the top (sickle is green, circle/star is red, scales are blue). The pictogram illustrates Neurath’s rules for visual language of having symbols with minimal details to visually represent facts, objects and statistics. These are combined to create a pictogram in a specific schema (Uyan Dur, 2015).</p>
          
          <h2 id="isot">ISOTYPE</h2>
          
          <p>Indeed, Figure 2 illustrates how Neurath’s pictogram system could be used as an effective educational tool as it comprised a simple way of presenting and visualising data which could be quickly processed and understood by the viewer. The method was eventually renamed by Neurath as ISOTYPE (Jansen, 2009: 227).  According to Uyan Dur (2015:1), “Otto Neurath in ISOTYPE pioneered modern data visulization and information graphics by presenting complicated statistical data in simple graphic forms''. Moreover, Uyam Dur highlighted how visual language provided “universal communication that can be understood by all people despite differences of language, culture and religion” (Uyan Dur, 2015:1). In short, icons have made a huge difference in today's world as you can glance at an image and understand what it means straight away no matter the language you speak (Vossoughian, 2008). </p>
          
          
          <h2 id="conc">CONCLUSION</h2>
          
          <p>In conclusion, Otto Neurath, a Viennese philosopher and educator developed visual language in the early decades of the twentieth century. As founder and director of the Austrian Museum of Society and Economy, Neurath was commissioned to educate the Viennese public about their city. Aware of the high levels of illiteracy, Neurath drew inspiration from previous publications which used picture diagrams and illustrations to convey statistical information. To achieve his goal of having museum exhibits which would be quickly understood by a broad range of spectators, Neurath collaborated with the designer Marie Reidemeister and the graphic artist Gerd Arntz as they were skilled in making basic silhouettes, signs and pictograms of subjects. </p>
          
          <p>To enable viewers to understand the information conveyed by the museum’s exhibits in a maximum of three glances, Neurath adhered to six rules. These included using colour to distinguish between different human beings and to indicate location, such as city or countryside. The schemas of pictorial language representing statistical data comprised two-dimensional diagrams, charts and infographics. The visual language became known as the Vienna Method of Pictorial Statistics.  Eventually, Neurath renamed his method the ‘International System of Typographic Picture Education’ or ISOTYPE.  In contemporary society, visual language is observable in diverse forms such as transport and traffic signs (Rawsthorn, 2011). Indeed, Neurath’s ISOTYPE system paved the way for modern infographic design and how information is presented visually</p>
